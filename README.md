# Conditional Imitation Learning (Keras)
Keras implementation of Conditional Imitation Learning (https://github.com/carla-simulator/imitation-learning) 

Dataset is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hloAeyamYn-H6MfV1dRtY1gJPhkR55sY/view) 

## TODO:
 * Train and test on both CARLA and Airsim
 * Improve data generator to avoid Out of Memory Error
 * Load all branches and backpropagate only to selected branch
 * Modify branches for racing
